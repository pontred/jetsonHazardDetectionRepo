# jetsonHazardDetectionRepo
***
This code is intended to function on a Jetson Nano. It requires the A1M8 Lidar made by Slamtec and a camera that is v4l2 compatible. Many webcams will be compatible. Fairly simple modifications can be made to make this code compatible with other types of cameras. For more information refer to the [Jetson-inference](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference) github.
